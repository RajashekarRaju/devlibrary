  "shortDescription": "DeliverableModel is a All In One pre-processing and post-processing integrated deep learning model deployment solution. The purpose of designing DeliverableModel is to reduce the difficulty of model deployment and inference as much as possible. Make deployment out of the box. The user does not need to know any implementation details to be able to make end-to-end inference, which greatly reduces the user's mental burden.",
